# Inflation Model {#inflation-model}

House of Stake uses a predictable and limited inflation mechanism to fund governance participation and platform sustainability.

## Key Parameters {#key-parameters}

- **Inflation rate:** 0.5% of total NEAR supply annually
- **Destination:** 100% of this inflation goes toward governance participation incentives
- **Distribution:** Split between veNEAR holders and eligible delegates

This model ensures that governance is sustainably funded without significant dilution to token holders.

## Rationale {#rationale}

- Encourages long-term locking and active participation
- Aligns economic incentives with governance quality
- Reduces reliance on ad-hoc treasury grants
- Creates a clear and bounded budget for governance operations

## Future Adjustments {#future-adjustments}

The inflation rate and its distribution model can be updated through governance if the community sees a need to adjust based on participation metrics, tokenomics, or ecosystem growth.
