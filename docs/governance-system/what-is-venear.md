# What is veNEAR

veNEAR (vote-escrowed NEAR) is a governance token that gives NEAR holders the ability to participate in House of Stake governance in a stake-weighted, time-locked manner.

By locking NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR tokens for a fixed period (from 3 months up to 4 years), users receive veNEAR. The longer the lock duration, the greater the voting power received. This mechanism aligns incentives for long-term commitment and active participation.

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-transferable:** veNEAR cannot be transferred or traded.
- **Time-weighted voting power:** Voting power increases with the lock duration.
- **Supports multiple NEAR assets:** NEAR, stNEAR, and liNEAR can be locked into veNEAR.

## Purpose of veNEAR

- Empower long-term stakeholders to influence the direction of NEAR governance.
- Provide a clear and predictable incentive structure via reward distribution.
- Encourage thoughtful participation and discourage manipulation.

## Why It Matters

veNEAR creates a strong alignment between governance power and economic commitment. Those with more at stake—literally and figuratively—have more influence, encouraging responsible, engaged decision-making that supports the long-term health of the ecosystem.
