# Security Council

The Security Council is a critical governance body responsible for ensuring the security, integrity, and operational resilience of the NEAR protocol. It serves as a final line of defense in the governance architecture of House of Stake, particularly during emergencies or critical protocol upgrades.

## Purpose

The Security Council exists to:

- Respond to urgent threats or security vulnerabilities
- Coordinate emergency actions (e.g., halts, patch deployments)
- Provide oversight during sensitive governance transitions
- Maintain trust in the network during crises

## Structure

The Council is composed of two types of members:

- **Core Members**: Permanent representatives from foundational NEAR ecosystem organizations (e.g., Near Foundation,Near One)
- **Key Members**: Independent or semi-independent contributors with technical or strategic expertise

This tiered composition ensures both institutional stability and diverse perspectives.

## Responsibilities

- Initiate emergency interventions when necessary
- Inform the community within 7 days after emergency actions
- Monitor proposals for potential malicious behavior
- Coordinate with developers, validators, and governance participants during upgrades
- Oversee technical integrity of the governance system
- Support the Screening Committee in identifying security risks

## Accountability

Security Council members are expected to act in the best interest of the NEAR ecosystem. While their powers are reserved for exceptional circumstances, transparency and clear communication are required after any intervention.

Over time, the Council’s composition and powers may evolve through on-chain governance decisions as the system matures.

├── Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)

# Responsibilities and Scope (RACI)

This section defines the roles and responsibilities of key governance participants within the House of Stake, using the RACI framework:

- **R – Responsible:** Who does the work
- **A – Accountable:** Who is ultimately answerable for the outcome
- **C – Consulted:** Who provides input or expertise
- **I – Informed:** Who must be kept up to date

## Example: Key Governance Processes

| Process                       | Screening Committee | Endorsed Delegates | Delegates | Security Council | veNEAR Holders |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Pre-screening grant proposals | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Voting on proposals           |                     | R, A               | R, A      | I                | R, A           |
| Selecting new delegates       | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Removing bad actors           | R                   |                    |           | C                | I              |
| Emergency intervention        |                     |                    |           | R, A             | I              |
| Updating reward frameworks    | R, A                |                    |           | C                | I              |

## Why RACI Matters

The RACI model clarifies responsibilities, reduces overlap, and increases transparency. It makes complex governance processes easier to understand and more efficient—especially in decentralized environments.
