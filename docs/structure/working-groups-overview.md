# Working Groups Overview

House of Stake is organized around several specialized Working Groups (WGs), each focused on a core area of governance and ecosystem development.

These groups are responsible for driving discussions, developing strategy, and coordinating execution in their respective domains. While delegates vote on proposals, WGs help shape those proposals and provide the expertise and operational support needed to make governance work.

## Current Working Groups

- **Governance Infrastructure & Processes WG**
  Focuses on improving governance architecture, voting systems, proposal processes, and tooling.

- **Ecosystem Growth Strategy WG**
  Works on expanding NEARâ€™s user base and developer ecosystem through strategic initiatives, partnerships, and incentive programs.

- **Treasury Strategy & Management WG**
  Designs frameworks for treasury allocation, funding guardrails, and financial reporting.

- **Network Economics & Security WG**
  Focuses on the sustainability of tokenomics, validator incentives, inflation tuning, and on-chain economic resilience.

Each group operates semi-independently, collaborates with delegates, and publishes progress updates regularly.

Community members can engage with WGs through forums, discussions, or proposals.
