# What is House of Stake

The **House of Stake (HoS)** is a governance framework designed to empower NEAR token holders with a transparent, efficient, and stake-weighted system of decision-making.

It replaces one-person-one-vote with a more aligned, long-term model based on **veNEAR** — a vote-escrowed token that rewards long-term commitment.

House of Stake was initiated in response to the limitations of previous governance models, particularly the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC), which struggled with engagement, transparency, and incentive alignment.

HoS aims to address these challenges by introducing:

- **Stake-weighted voting** via veNEAR
- **Pre-screening of proposals** by a Screening Committee
- **Delegate system** with clear roles and incentives
- **Structured funding** from the 0.5% protocol inflation
- **On-chain voting and transparent processes**

The vision is to create a sustainable, decentralized, and user-owned governance system that evolves with the ecosystem’s needs.

This documentation outlines how the House of Stake works, how to participate, and how it will shape the future of NEAR governance.
