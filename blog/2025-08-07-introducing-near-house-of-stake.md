## **Introducing NEAR House of Stake: A New Era of Governance**

## **NEAR House of Stake Is Officially Live on Mainnet**

Today, the NEAR Protocol enters a new chapter in its evolution. We're proud to announce the mainnet launch of **House of Stake**: a next-generation governance system designed to be transparent, scalable, and adaptive. More than just a tool, it's the first step in a multi-phase transformation of how NEAR is governed—and, eventually, how governance itself is reimagined.

**Phase one**, now underway, is about bootstrapping: building foundational infrastructure, establishing legitimacy, and delivering a functional and accountable system of stake-weighted governance. It's a pragmatic design, relying on delegated voting and token lockups—not because we believe token-weighted voting is ideal, but because it's currently the most effective Sybil resistance tool we have. In this respect, House of Stake ensures long-term alignment: all participants must lock $NEAR, and the longer they lock, the more voting power they receive.

**Future phases are more ambitious.** In **phase two**, House of Stake will take on broader responsibilities across the NEAR ecosystem, starting with improving protocol economics. In **phase three**, AI becomes a first-class participant in governance—supporting decision-making, managing workflows, and eventually unlocking new models like "swarm governance," where intelligent agents can represent the preferences of thousands of stakeholders at once.

We're not building a governance tool. We're building the foundation for **a new kind of institution**—one that can scale with the network, adapt to its needs, and bring democratic ideals into programmable systems.

### **Why House of Stake?**

Two years ago, NEAR's initial governance experiment—the NEAR Digital Collective (NDC)—pushed the boundaries of community-led funding and participation. But it also surfaced persistent challenges: low voter turnout, poor incentive design, and limited alignment between stakeholder capital and influence.

House of Stake is a clean break. It replaces "one person, one vote" with a flexible, token-locked voting mechanism called **veNEAR** (vote-escrowed NEAR), which strengthens governance influence based on time-locked commitment. Proposals are screened for alignment and quality before going to a vote, and incentives are structured to encourage participation.

This system is designed not only to work—but to evolve. To guide that evolution, we're actively tracking how it performs—beyond just on-chain metrics.

**What does success look like?**

* Consistently high delegate participation and proposal engagement

* Quality and clarity of proposals passing the screening process

* Diverse stakeholder representation (not just whales)

* Growing trust in the process, measured through surveys and forum feedback

* Effective use of incentives: are rewards driving real contribution or just farming?

### **What's Been Built**

The House of Stake framework is already live on testnet, and its core components are rolling out on mainnet today:

* **veNEAR Governance Token**: Users lock NEAR, stNEAR, or liNEAR to receive veNEAR. The longer the lock, the greater the voting power and rewards. This is a pragmatic approach: stake-weighted governance isn't perfect—it [trends plutocratic](https://rettig.substack.com/p/embracing-plutocracy)—but it's currently the most effective Sybil resistance mechanism available. Our ambition is to evolve toward more democratic and identity-aware models as the technology matures.

* **Delegation System**: A curated group of [**Endorsed Delegates**](https://gov.near.org/t/announcing-the-initial-set-of-endorsed-delegates/40815) help scale decision-making. They're required to maintain high participation rates, disclose their rationale, and act in line with the community's goals.

* **Screening Committee and Security Council**: These oversight bodies ensure that governance is safe, credible, and efficient. The Screening Committee reviews proposals before they go to a vote; the Security Council has a final veto and can act quickly in emergencies.

* **On-chain Voting + Incentives**: Using NEAR's 0.5% annual token inflation, as well as future protocol-generated revenue sources (intents, AI infrastructure, etc.), the system funds veNEAR holders, active delegates, and community-approved grant proposals—creating a sustainable, protocol-native governance economy.

### **Beyond Token Voting**

House of Stake was designed from day one to grow into a more expansive system. Here's a high-level look at what comes next:

**Phase One (Now)**:

* Launch veNEAR and the on-chain voting system

* Community elects the screening committee and begins proposal screening

* Distribute early incentives and test mechanisms

* Ship foundational infrastructure (contracts, frontend, onboarding, documentation)

**Phase Two**:

* House of Stake expands its scope: funding more verticals, coordinating more protocol functions

* Begins to own protocol economics and budgetary governance

* Introduces more robust delegate frameworks, forum tooling, and working groups

* Runs on-chain experiments in public goods allocation and participatory budgeting

**Phase Three:**

* Deep AI integration: agents that help interpret, vote on, and even propose governance actions

* Agents are trained on user values and community norms: governance copilots and autonomous delegates

* Governance agents represent thousands of users' preferences, run simulations of policy outcomes, and automatically adjust decisions based on community sentiment

* "Swarm governance": a network of AI actors collaborating on behalf of their human stakeholders, coordinating at scales humans can't match

* Real-world lessons exported to cooperatives, civic networks, and other governance domains

The House of Stake roadmap goes far beyond features. We're adopting cutting-edge technologies and working at the fringes of what's possible, and we'll share the tools we build and the things we learn with the wider world.

### **Why It Matters**

Blockchains today face a dual legitimacy crisis. On-chain governance often devolves into plutocracy, while off-chain democratic systems are overwhelmed by misinformation and apathy. House of Stake takes both problems seriously and attempts to do something that's never been done before.

By combining **transparent incentives, structured participation, and AI-augmented tooling**, House of Stake is setting a precedent for governance that works—not just for NEAR, but as a blueprint for the next generation of global, digital institutions.

And we're doing it in the open, together, with community participation as both a mechanism and a goal.

### **How to Get Involved**

Participation is permissionless, and getting started is easy:

* **Lock NEAR into veNEAR** to gain governance power (live on testnet)

* **Read and comment on proposals** on [gov.near.org](https://gov.near.org/)

* **Join the discussion** on [Telegram](https://t.me/NEAR_HouseOfStake)

* **Follow progress** via [@NEARGovernance](https://x.com/NEARGovernance)

* **Become a delegate** by convincing others to delegate their veNEAR to you, or delegate to yourself and simply vote on proposals you care about

Whether you're a validator, a developer, a researcher, or a curious community member, there's a seat for you in the House.

### **Final Thoughts**

House of Stake isn't the endgame. It's phase one.

We know the system we're launching today isn't perfect. It leans on token-weighted governance because, for now, that's what scales. But it's built with humility and ambition: humility to acknowledge its limitations, and ambition to design something better over time.

In future phases, we'll build toward more democratic, AI-assisted models. We'll push governance to be faster, fairer, more inclusive, and more intelligent. If we succeed, NEAR won't just be the "blockchain for AI." It'll be a proving ground for better institutions everywhere.

**The moment to act is now.**

The foundations are still being laid, and early participation gives you more than voting power, it gives you influence over the very shape of this system. Whether you're a builder, researcher, validator, or simply someone who cares about better coordination, we need you in the House.

Join the testnet. Read the proposals. Ask questions. Propose ideas. Help House of Stake lead a real governance revolution.
