**Change of purpose**

We will only use your personal data for the purposes for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider its usage necessary for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If you wish to get an explanation as to how the processing for the new purpose is compatible with the original purpose, please submit a request to privacy@near.org.

If we or our service providers need to use your personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and explain the legal basis permitting such use.

Please note that we and our service providers may process your personal data without your knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law.

- Internal Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.
- External Third Parties as set out in the Glossary.

Third parties to whom we and our service providers may choose to sell, transfer or merge parts of our business or our assets. Alternatively, we or our service providers may seek to acquire other businesses or merge with them. If a change happens to our or our service providers’ business, then the new owners may use your personal data according to their own privacy practices.

We contract with third-party vendors to require that they do not use your personal data for their own purposes and to authorize them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with our instructions.

**International transfers**

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), Switzerland and the United Kingdom we will endeavour to ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:

We or our service providers will transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection of personal data in non-EU countries: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/adequacy-decisions\_en.

Where we or our service providers use certain vendors, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for the transfer of personal data to third countries: https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc\_en.

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used when transferring your personal data outside your jurisdiction.

**Data security**

We have in place security measures intended to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed.

**Data retention**

We have implemented measures intended to ensure that we will not retain your personal data longer than is necessary to fulfil the purposes it was collected for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. Note, however, that if we or our service providers have a legitimate interest in retaining the data, or if we are required to do so by applicable law, we will retain the data in accordance with our respective data retention plans and policies.

In some circumstances we and our service providers may choose to anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes, in which case we and our service providers may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.

**Your legal rights**

Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. You may: (1) request access to your personal data; (2) request correction of your personal data; (3) request erasure of your personal data; (4) object to processing of your personal data; (5) request restriction of processing your personal data; (6) request transfer of your personal data; or (7) right to withdraw consent by contacting [info@houseofstake.org](mailto:info@houseofstake.org).

**No fee usually required**

You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.

**What we and our service providers may need from you**

We and our service providers may need to request specific information from you to help confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights), including your: NEAR wallet address, associated email address (if applicable), and an email to be used for future communication. This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We and our service providers may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

**Time limit to respond**

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we or our service providers will notify you and keep you updated.

**Glossary**

**Legitimate Interest** means the interest of our business in conducting and managing the business and enabling us and our service providers to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience that we can offer. We make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before processing your personal data for such legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we or our service providers have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess such legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by submitting a request to [info@houseofstake.org](mailto:info@houseofstake.org).

**YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS**

**Request access** to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

**Request correction** of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we and our service providers may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide.

**Request erasure** of your personal data. This enables you to request deletion or removal of personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your information unlawfully or where are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we and our service providers may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.

**Object to processing** of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for our and our service providers’ processing of your information which override your rights and freedoms.

**Request restriction of processing** of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:

- If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
- Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want to erase it.
- Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it, as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
- You have objected to our use of your data but such data is necessary to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.

**Request the transfer** of your personal data to you or to a third party. We or will provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us or our service providers to use or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.

**Withdraw consent** at any time where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we and our service providers may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
